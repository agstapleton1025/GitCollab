#Task 1: A fast forward merge is when a changed branch merges with an unchanged branch, creating a linear history of changes and no conflicts.
#Task 2b: Changed a P tag in conflict branch then edited the same p tag that existsed in the develop branch and merged the two branched together to create a conflict.
#Task 2c: We changed a title in the develop branch and added a p tag in the conflict brance, when we merged the two together there was not a conflict even though we changed something in both branches.
